# Laser Motion - Laser Gesture Sensing Module
Trial to set up laser gesture sensing. 
The crude operating instructions are in the power point show. The app needs to be installed on an Android Smartphone with android Kitkat or above. The app is designed with MIT App Inventor 2 so may cause issues with some older android versions. App is tested okay on a Motorola Moto X Play running Android Marshmallow version 6.0.1.
The microcontroller used was ATmega328p(Arduino NANO R3) and it was quite error free. Any suggestions are welcome :)

## WARNING:

!!  TOTALLY UNDER TESTING so not meant to be replicated without proper knowledge, may be dangerous in some cases !!
!!  this project uses LASER Diodes which can be very harmful if mishandled, appropriate precautionary measures to be taken  !!
